<h3>IsoQuant 3.3, 13 June 2023</h3>

<p>Fixed read to novel models assignment.</p>

<p>Improved command line options for providing multiple files, added <code>--prefix</code> option.</p>

<p>Additional checks for various unusual cases in input GTFs.</p>

<p>Do not output empty files when no GTF is provided.</p>

<h3>IsoQuant 3.2, 27 March 2023</h3>

<p>Unspliced novel transcripts are not reported by the default for ONT data, use <code>--report_novel_unspliced</code> to generate them.</p>

<p>When multiple BAM/FASTQ files are provided via <code>--bam</code> / <code>--fastq</code>,
    they are treated as different replicas/samples of the same experiment;
    a single GTF and per-sample counts are generated automatically.</p>

<p>10-15 times lower RAM consumption with the same running time.</p>

<p>~5 times lower disk consumption for temporary files.</p>

<p><code>--low_memory</code> option has no effect (used by default); <code>--high_memory</code> mimics old behavior by storing alignments in RAM.</p>

<p>Read assignment reports transcript start and end (TSS/TES) matches.</p>

<p><code>--sqanti_output</code> generates SQANTI-like output for novel vs reference transcripts.</p>

<p>Resulting annotation contains exon ids.</p>

<p>Supplementary gene attributes are copied from the reference annotation to the output annotations.</p>

<p>Improved <code>--resume</code> and <code>--force</code> behaviour.</p>

<p><code>--model_construction_strategy sensitive_pacbio</code> is now more sensitive.</p>

<h3>IsoQuant 3.1.2, 7 February 2023</h3>

<p>Fixed strand detection that caused lower precision for novel transcripts.</p>

<p>Fixed known transcript filtering that caused lower recall.</p>

<p>Fixed duplicate transcript entries in the output annotation.</p>

<p>Fixed duplicate canonical attribute in extended annotation.</p>

<p>Fix <code>--resume</code> option when relative paths were provided.</p>

<h3>IsoQuant 3.1.1, 16 January 2023</h3>

<h3>IsoQuant 3.1.0, 3 January 2023</h3>

<p>Intermediate BAM files have nicer names.</p>

<p>Proper single-thread mode without thread pool usage.

<h3>IsoQuant 2.3.0, 27 May 2022</h3>

<p>Possibility to provide read group tables in gzipped format.</p>

<h3>IsoQuant 2.2.2, 18 May 2022</h3>
